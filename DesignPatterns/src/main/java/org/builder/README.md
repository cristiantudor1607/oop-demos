## Builder Design Pattern

### Basic Builder

- Implemented in **org.builder.simplebuilder** package.
- It's the easiest way to make a builder, very powerful at **_customization_**.
- For this builder, the **mandatory fields** are just a convention. The object can be created even if none of
the required fields were set.
